## Learning outcomes:
This was my first Python project using Flask and Jinja 2. Server side rendering the project was new coming from single page applications. I learned a lot about the power of using templates to drive site with data from a database. This was also my first time taking out PostgreSQL for a spin and it presented some challanges with the complex queries that were needed to recreate Twitter's functionality. The hardest implementation was likes and rechirps. Likes needed to limited to one user like per chirp post.
